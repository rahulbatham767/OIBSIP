        text: 'Red wine are defined by their dark fruit flavors and tannins that make them a great match for food. Oak aging plays a part in many red wines. Red wines are made from black-skinned grapes that have colorless juice. When the grapes are pressed at the winery the grape skins mix with the juice (called must) to create a reddish-purple beverage.',

        wine: 'White Wine',
        text: 'White wines are made from green-skinned grapes whose juice is also colorless. For white wines, the grape skins are removed from the must before fermentation. Acid structure and aroma are more important in white wines because they lack the tannins that red wines have from contact with the grape skins.White wines tend to be more tart and refreshing than reds, with aromatic notes like flowers, citrus, and orchard fruits. White wines are usually lighter in body and in alcohol',

        wine: 'Rose Wine',
        text: 'Rosé wines are made from red grapes, but the grape skins are removed from the must after a short period of maceration (usually less than 24 hours). The skins give the wine its pink color but do not impart much tannin. Rosé wines can have flavors common to red wines, like strawberry, cherry, and raspberry, and also more typical white wine flavors, like citrus and tropical fruit.',

        text: 'Sparkling wines can be white, rosé, or red in color. They can be made from any grape varieties, depending on the appellation rules of the area where they are made. Sparkling wines can be single-varietal wines or made from a blend of grapes. Sugar content in sparkling wines varies from dry (like brut nature Champagne) to sweet (like Moscato d’Asti). Most sparkling wines contain a few grams of sugar to balance their high acidity.',

        wine: 'Fortified Wine',
        text: 'Fortified wines (called vin de liqueur in Europe) are made by adding distilled grape spirit to fully- or partially-fermented wine. Most fortified wines are sweet, with the exception of certain dry styles of sherry. Fortified wines include Port, Madeira, Marsala, sherry, macvin, and the vin doux naturels of southern France. Fortified wines like vermouth are sometimes aromatized with herbs and botanicals. Fortified wines are higher in alcohol than other types of wine.',
